### Local Development Setup
After the "Installation" section and before "Privacy & Security", let's add:

Here‚Äôs the formatted section ready for direct pasting into your README file:  

```
## Local Development Setup  

### 1. Clone the Repository  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/RAVI-RAJPUT-UMATH/Women_Safety.git
cd Women_Safety
```

### 2. Setup Local Server  
You can use any local server to run the application:  

- **Python**:  
  ```bash
  python -m http.server 8000
  ```  
- **Node.js** (Install http-server globally first):  
  ```bash
  npm install -g http-server  
  http-server
  ```  
- **VS Code**: Use the `"Live Server"` extension for easy hosting.  

### 3. Access the Application  
Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to:  

- **Python Server**: [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)  
- **http-server (Node.js)**: [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)  
- **Live Server (VS Code)**: [http://localhost:5500](http://localhost:5500)  

### 4. Enable Required Permissions  
To ensure the application functions properly, allow the following permissions when prompted:  

- **Location Access**: Required for real-time tracking.  
- **Microphone Access**: Needed for audio recording features.  
- **Notifications**: Enables emergency alerts.  

### 5. Testing the Features  
After setup, test the key functionalities:  

- ‚úÖ Verify the **SOS button** functionality.  
- ‚úÖ Ensure **location tracking** is working.  
- ‚úÖ Test **audio recording** capabilities.  
- ‚úÖ Try submitting a **test complaint**.
